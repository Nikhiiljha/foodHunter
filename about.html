    <p style="color: maroon"><B>First, we eat. Then, we do everything else.
        I’m not drooling, you are!<BR>
        Is it just me or does this meal look more scrumptious because I’m on a diet?<BR>
        I like people who love to eat. They’re the best kind of people in the world.<BR>
        Live, love, eat.<BR>
        Made with love.<BR>
        To live a full life, you have to fill your stomach first.<BR>
        Carbs might be my soulmate.<BR>
        All I want for Christmas is...food.<BR>
        Never eat more than you can lift.<BR>
        The most essential part of a well-balanced diet is—food!<BR>
        Dear diet, things just aren’t looking good for the both of us. It’s not me, it’s you. You’re too much work. You’re boring and I can’t stop cheating on you.
        Hunger is a good cook.<BR>
        A little slice of heaven.<BR>
        Good food never fail in bringing people together.<BR>
        Eat right, exercise, die anyway.<BR>
        It’s essential for every party to have cake. If there’s no cake, then it’s only a meeting.<BR>
        9 out of 10 people love chocolate. And the 10th person is always lying.<BR>
        The chief ingredient in yummy food is love.<BR>
        There is no better reward for hard work than good food.<BR>
        They told me to follow my heart. Guess where it led me? To the fridge.<BR>
        Skinny people are easier to kidnap. Stay safe, eat cake.<BR>
        I’m soy into you.<BR>
        Life is about exploring the pasta-billities.<BR>
        Grill and chill!<BR>
        Good people, good food, good time.</B></p><BR>
